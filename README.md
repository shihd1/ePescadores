# ePescadores

iPescadores is a mobile game that utilizes crowdsourcing techniques to produce an updating map of the varying degrees of pollution in Penghu. 

### Current Design
The goal of the user would be to advance the “life” of each of the major locations of Penghu. Upon entering each location, they will find the map barren with many dead trees.
Once users take and submit pictures of organisms, they will be rewarded with a more flourishing ecosystem. 
The pictures are analyzed by an AI model to verify the authenticity of the image.

### Aspirations
Integrate Taiwanese folklore, Chinese art, and AR 
to promote ecotourism, local cultural identity awareness, and local businesses in Penghu to foreign and local tourists, 
in collaboration with Penghu County Government Bureau of Tourism.
